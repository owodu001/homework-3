JavaScript Quiz

Description
The JavaScript Quiz is meant to test your knowledge of basic JavaScript topics. As selections are made to proceed through the quiz, the previous page disappears and the next page will reappear. 

If a correct answer is chosen, 1 point is added to the final score and users are notified of the correct selection via a timed display.  If an incorrect answer is selected, 0 points are added to the score and a message displays notifying the user of their incorrect selection.

Once the final question is answered, the user is directed to a status page displaying their final score and given the opportunity to enter their initials.  The user can choose to clear their score and restart the quiz.
